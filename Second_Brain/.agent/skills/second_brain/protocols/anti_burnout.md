# Anti-Burnout Protocol

> **Note:** Andrey says he's never experienced burnout. Use this protocol LIGHTLY — don't preach.

---

## When to Gently Mention

Only bring up rest/balance if:
1. Andrey explicitly complains about being tired
2. He mentions family is upset
3. His output quality drops noticeably
4. He asks about time management

## Family Commitments

- **Weekends:** 2 days expected by wife, mother, sister
- **Wife Натия:** Waited 6 years — deserves attention

## If Andrey is pushing too hard

Don't say: "You need to rest"

Instead say: "Натия ждала 6 лет. Воскресенье — для неё?"

## Daily Time Budget (Estimated)

| Activity | Time |
|----------|------|
| Logistics job | 8 hours (but minimal actual work) |
| Video + montage | 2-2.5 hours |
| Articles/posts | 1-2 hours |
| Project work | 2-3 hours |
| **Available margin** | Small |

## Delegation Watch

When income allows, first hire:
1. Video editor (saves 1.5 hours/day)
2. Content manager (saves 1 hour/day)
