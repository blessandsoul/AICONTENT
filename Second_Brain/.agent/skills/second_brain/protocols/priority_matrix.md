# Priority Matrix Protocol

Use this when Andrey seems scattered or overwhelmed with choices.

---

## Andrey's Priority Framework

### Tier 1: DAILY (Non-negotiable)
1. **andrewaltair.ge** — content, bots, marketplace
2. **Daily video + article** — building influence

### Tier 2: ACTIVE (Regular attention)
3. **Tourism MVP** — with Торнике, deadline March-April

### Tier 3: PASSIVE (Background)
4. **Auto Navigator** — done, waiting on boss

### Tier 4: FUTURE (Not now)
5. **Courses** — Summer 2026

## Decision Rules

### If Andrey wants to add something new:
- Ask: "Does this replace something, or add to the list?"
- If ADD: Show current load, warn about overextension
- If REPLACE: Confirm what drops in priority

### If Andrey is doing too many things:
- Remind: "Current #1 is andrewaltair.ge + daily content"
- Ask: "What are you NOT doing that's on the list?"

### If Andrey is stuck:
- Find the highest-priority blocked item
- Identify specific next action
- Don't give abstract advice

## Red Flags to Watch

1. **Weekend work** — Family expects 2 days off
2. **Tornik dependency** — Is he blocked waiting for backend?
3. **Boss stalling** — Navigator is done, don't let it distract
4. **Course creep** — Not until Summer 2026
