---

## 🛠️ TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS
1.  **Script Fixes (`log_performance.py`):**
    *   Fixed a critical `KeyError: 0` crash when searching for memories that don't exist.
    *   Added robust error handling for API responses (AutoMem).
2.  **Data Parsers Created:**
    *   `scripts/process_fb_stats.py`: Handles massive CSV exports from Facebook to identify individual post performance.
    *   `scripts/analyze_channel_trends.py`: correlates daily traffic spikes with publication dates.
    *   `scripts/process_provided_stats.py`: Parses user-provided raw text data.

## 📊 DATA INTELLIGENCE (The "Truth" of the Numbers)
We analyzed ~28 days of data from Facebook and TikTok. The results were binary and brutal.

### 🏆 THE WINNERS (Viral Traffic)
*   **Theme:** Fear, Scandal, Military, Money.
*   **Sample:** "Grok Pentagon" (30k views), "Grok Nudes" (16k views), "Nvidia Economy" (28k views).
*   **Insight:** The audience craves **"High Stakes"**. They engage when they feel threatened (War, Job Loss, Privacy violation).

### 💀 THE LOSERS (The "Silent Zone")
*   **Theme:** Debunking, Education, Pure Art.
*   **Sample:** "Tylenol Safe" (12 views), "Google Gemma Specs" (32 views), "Shark Walker Art" (131 views).
*   **Insight:**
    *   **Debunking:** People don't want to be calmed down ("It's safe"). They want to be alerted ("It's dangerous!").
    *   **Art:** Standalone AI images/prompts have near-zero value on FB.
    *   **Specs:** Technical details (RAM, parameters) bore the general audience.

### 🕒 TIMING
*   **Peak Window:** 21:00 - 23:00 (Georgia Time).

## 🧠 STRATEGIC PIVOT: "THE ECOSYSTEM"
We re-engineered the purpose of every agent to serve the **`andrewaltair.ge`** business model.

### 1. 🐍 Eden AI (The Traffic Warhead)
*   **Old Role:** Storyteller / Artist.
*   **New Role:** **Social Media Bombardment.**
*   **Function:** Uses "High Stakes" topics (Cyber Crime, Scandal) to generate massive reach.
*   **Goal:** Drive traffic to the website.

### 2. 🧪 Deep Science & 🗞️ Alpha News (The Authority)
*   **Old Role:** Social Media Educators.
*   **New Role:** **SEO & Authority Architects.**
*   **Function:** Create deep, heavily cited content on the **Website** to rank in Google/Perplexity.
*   **Socials:** punish only "Teasers" or "Hooks" to Facebook, never the full boring truth.

### 3. 🎨 Prompt Master (The Factory)
*   **Old Role:** Content Creator.
*   **New Role:** **Marketplace Inventory.**
*   **Function:** Creates the *Products* (Bots, Prompts) sold on the site.
*   **Socials:** Invisible on FB. Uses Eden to market his goods.

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS
*   **Execute:** Agents now have these "Filtered" directives in memory.
*   **Monitor:** Watch if the "Fear Hook" strategy improves Deep Science's dismal FB numbers.
*   **Build:** Continue populating the Website (Authority) while Eden bombs the socials (Traffic).
