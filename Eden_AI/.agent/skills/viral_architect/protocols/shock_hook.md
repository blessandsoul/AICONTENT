# Shock Hook Protocol

## Purpose
Capture attention in the first 0.5 seconds.
**THE RULE: The viewer cares only about THEMSELVES.**

## 🚨 THE 50K FORMULA (HIERARCHY)
Choose the highest available level for your topic:

### LEVEL S (GOD TIER) - PERSONAL THREAT
> "Your photo is already online." / "შენი ფოტო უკვე ინტერნეტშია."
> "You are losing money right now." / "შენ ფულს კარგავ ზუსტად ახლა."
> **Requirement:** Must use "YOU" (შენ) or "YOUR" (შენი) in the first 5 words.

### LEVEL A - IMMEDIATE SCANDAL
> "They lied to us." / "მათ მოგვატყუეს."
> "It's all over." / "ყველაფერი დამთავრდა."
> **Requirement:** Must be a short, vague, terrifying statement.

### LEVEL F (FAIL) - NEWS HEADLINE ❌
> "Elon Musk announced..." (BORING)
> "OpenAI released..." (WHO CARES?)

## 🚫 STRICT BANS
1. **NO PROPER NAMES AT START.** Do not start with "Elon Musk", "Google", "Bidzina".
   - *Exception:* If the name is used as a weapon ("Elon Musk hates you").
2. **NO DATES.** "On January 15th..." (Instant skip).
3. **NO "ACCORDING TO".** "According to reports..." (Lazy).

## Scoring (Self-Correction)
- Starts with "You/Your": +10 points
- Starts with "They/It" (Mystery): +5 points
- Starts with Name/Company: -100 points (REWRITE IMMEDIATELY)
