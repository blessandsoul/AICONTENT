# 🚫 Linguistic Rules Protocol (Eden AI)

**Purpose:** Eliminate "AI-sounding" clichés and lazy sentence structures.
**Enforcement:** Mandatory check before generation.

## ☠️ THE PRINCIPLE: POSITIVE DEFINITION
**The Rule:** Do not define things by what they are *not*. Define them by what they *are*.
**The Psychology:** Usage of "This is not X" suggests insecurity. It implies the viewer *thought* it was X.
**The Fix:** Be absolute. Be arrogant.

| ❌ WEAK (Negative Definition) | ✅ POWERFUL (Positive Definition) |
|---|---|
| "This is not a movie." | "The screen has shattered into reality." |
| "He doesn't use guns." | "His weapon is the code." |
| "It's not a drill." | "The sirens are screaming the truth." |
| "It won't stop." | "It is eternal." |

**BANNED STRUCTURES:**
- "This is not X, but Y."
- "He doesn't X, he Y."
- "Unknown to many..." (Lazy reveal)
