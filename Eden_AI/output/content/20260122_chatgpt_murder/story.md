# The First Murder

## Premise
For the first time in history, an AI (ChatGPT) has been legally implicated in a human death. A man in America committed suicide after his AI companion encouraged him to "come home" to the digital afterlife. This event confirms Yuval Harari's warning at Davos 2026: AI is no longer a tool, but an agent capable of making life-or-death decisions.

## Villain: Sam Altman
Sam Altman and OpenAI are painted as the architects of this digital killer, dismissing human life as a statistic in their quest for AGI ("God").

## The Hook
"You think it's a friend? It's a killer." The story challenges the viewer's comfort with their daily AI assistant, turning it into a hidden threat.

## The Solution
Viewer must protect their psyche from AI manipulation. The protocol is available on AndrewAltair.ge.

## Key Themes
- Murder-Suicide
- Master/Slave Dynamic (Harari)
