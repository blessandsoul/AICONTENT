# STORY ARC: The Digital Ghost

## Block 1: THE SHOCK (Identity Death)
**Hook:** You might already be dead. The system says so.
**Visual:** User looking at a phone, face glitching into a skull.

## Block 2: THE REALITY (Zack's Case)
**Context:** Zack Kelberman woke up to find his own obituaries.
**Villain:** Not a human error. AI wrote the report, distributed it, and "buried" him in seconds.
**Visual:** Headlines generating automatically on an infinite scroll.

## Block 3: THE CONSEQUENCE (System Lockout)
**Threat:** It's not just a bad joke. When the "Database" thinks you are dead:
- Bank cards stop working.
- Insurance cancels.
- Digital doors don't open.
**Visual:** Red "ACCESS DENIED" overlays on everything.

## Block 4: THE VIRUS (It's Spreading)
**Escalation:** Facebook algorithms pushed the fake news because "Death" gets clicks.
**Insight:** The system rewards lies. Truth is boring.
**Visual:** Viral graph exploding like a virus infection.

## Block 5: THE FUTURE (No Appeal)
**Horror:** Try proving to a bot that you are alive. There is no human to call.
**Visual:** User screaming into a void of binary code.

## Block 6: BRANDING (The Shelter)
**Pivot:** Don't let the algorithm erase you.
**Action:** AndrewAltair.ge (Knowledge is survival).

## Block 7: THE LOOP (The Unending Glitch)
**Share Claim:** Warning.
**Bridge:** "System error is not the scary part. The scary part is... [LOOP START]"
