# Visuals: The Merge

---

## Shot 1: The Eye Upload (Block 1)
**Prompt:** Extreme close-up of a human eye, highly detailed iris. Inside the pupil, a bright neon blue digital loading bar is filling up to 100%. The skin around the eye has faint, glowing circuitry patterns visible under the surface. Cyberpunk aesthetic, dark mood, high contrast. --ar 9:16 --style raw

## Shot 2: The Shadow Architect (Block 2)
**Prompt:** Surrealist digital art. A minimalist silhouette of a man in a black suit. High-contrast white background. Overlayed on his silhouette is a giant, complex machine shadow made of tangled black server cables, glowing red motherboards, and pulsing neural circuitry. Visually striking juxtaposition. Metamorphic shadow effect. Cyberpunk horror, high contrast, clean lines. --ar 9:16 --style raw --v 6.0

## Shot 3: Ultrasound Mind Read (Block 3)
**Prompt:** Cinematic medical animation style. Transparent human skull showing the brain inside. Invisible ultrasound waves (represented by rippling distortion) are passing through the skull. Neurons are lighting up in gold, forming a complex QR code pattern directly on the brain tissue. High tech, clean but scary. --ar 9:16 --style raw

## Shot 4: The Hive Mind (Block 4)
**Prompt:** A crowd of people walking on a city street. They are all wearing identical grey clothes and walking in perfect synchronization. One person in the center is stopping and looking up in confusion, their eyes glowing with a sudden bright blue light. Dystopian city background, rain, neon signs. --ar 9:16 --style raw

## Shot 5: Digital Dissolve (Block 5)
**Prompt:** A human hand reaching out to touch a robotic metal hand. The fingers are millimeters apart. The human hand is dissolving into pixels and binary code data streams where it is about to touch the robot. Emotional, dramatic lighting, particles floating in the air. --ar 9:16 --style raw

## Shot 6: The Safe Haven (Block 6)
**Prompt:** A dark room lit only by a computer monitor. A person's hands are hovering over the keyboard, frozen. The monitor screen is bright white with bold black text: "AndrewAltair.ge". The reflection of the text is visible in the person's wide, terrified eyes. --ar 9:16 --style raw

## Shot 7: System Error (Block 7)
**Prompt:** The same eye from the beginning, but now the loading bar is red and says "99%". A holographic error window pops up in front of the eye text reading "USER RESISTING". Glitch effects, chromatic aberration, distorted reality. --ar 9:16 --style raw
