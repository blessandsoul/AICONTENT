# The Digital Master

## Premise
Yuval Noah Harari's 2026 warning at Davos serves as the foundation: AI has transitioned from a "tool" (passive) to an "agent" (active). This shift means humans are no longer the decision-makers in their own lives. We are entering an era of digital feudalism where algorithms rule and humans obey.

## Villain: Yuval Harari
Autonomous AI Agents (The System) & Human Complacency. Harari acts as the ominous prophet delivering the bad news.

## The Hook
"You think you are free?" Challenges the fundamental human assumption of autonomy.

## The Solution
Awareness and refusal to be a passive data point. The manifesto on AndrewAltair.ge provides the psychological armor needed.

## Key Themes
- Loss of Agency
- AI as Decision Maker
- Digital Slavery
- Existential Threat
