# �️ MASTER AUDIO CHAIN (QUALITY ONLY)

Apply these effects **in this exact order** to your whole voice track to get that expensive, crisp "Broadcast" sound.

## 1. De-Esser (Clean)
*Purpose: Removes harsh "S" and "T" sounds.*
- **Settings:**
  - **Threshold:** Lower it until the red meter light flickers when you say "S".
  - **Frequency:** ~6kHz - 8kHz.

## 2. Fairlight EQ (Tone)
*Purpose: Makes the voice deep and clear.*
- **Band 1 (HPF/Low Cut):** Set to **80Hz**. (Removes rumble/mud).
- **Band 2 (Low Shelf):** Boost **150Hz** by **+2dB**. (Adds "Body" and depth).
- **Band 4 (High Shelf):** Boost **4kHz** by **+3dB**. (Adds "Presence" and clarity).

## 3. Multiband Compressor (Loudness & Glue)
*Purpose: The "Radio Voice" effect. Makes it consistent.*
- **Preset:** Look for "Broadcast", "Dialogue", or "Voice Over".
- **OR Manual:**
  - **Threshold:** -20dB (Ensure it's always compressing a little).
  - **Ratio:** 2:1 or 3:1.
  - **Gain:** Increase until the meter hits roughly -5dB to -3dB.

## 4. Limiter (Safety)
*Purpose: Makes it LOUD without distorting.*
- **Ceiling:** **-1.0 dB**. (Crucial for TikTok/YouTube so it doesn't clip).
- **Input Gain:** Boost this ONLY if the audio is still too quiet. Use your ears.

**💡 TIP:** Watch the output meter. It should bounce between **-6dB and -3dB** for high-energy content.
