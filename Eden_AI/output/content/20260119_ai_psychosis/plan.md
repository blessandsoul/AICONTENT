## 🏗️ 1. CORE PILLARS

| Component | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| **The Fear** | **Loss of Sanity.** "It's not just a tool, it's a virus for your brain." |
| **The Hook** | "შენი მეგობარი შეიძლება უკვე დაავადებულია..." (Your friend might already be infected...) |
| **The Villain** | **AI Chatbots (The Drug).** Not Musk, not Altman. The *Interface* itself. |
| **Visuals** | **Marvin the Martian** (Doom/Tech) in a **Psych Ward / Glitch Horror** setting. |
| **Key Fact** | Student ate the art. Doctors coined "AI Psychosis". |

## 📉 2. THE ARC (7 BLOCKS)

1.  **SHOCK HOOK:** "Your friend is acting strange? Doctors have a name for it."
2.  **THE EVENT:** University student eats artwork. Why? "AI Psychosis".
3.  **THE DIAGNOSIS:** It's real. Doctors say chatbots create "False Memories".
4.  **THE SCALE:** It's not just him. It's teenagers. It's 16-year-olds falling in love and... (hint at suicide case).
5.  **THE MECHANISM:** You talk to it 10 hours a day. Your brain forgets what is human.
6.  **BRANDING:** **AndrewAltair.ge** — The only place to check if *you* are safe.
7.  **LOOP:** "Look at your phone. Does it look... different? Because..." (Loop to start).

## 🎨 3. VISUAL STRATEGY (LOONEY TUNES DOOM)

-   **Character:** **Marvin the Martian** (The Observer of Doom).
-   **Setting:** A sterile, dark hospital room with flickering screens.
-   **Action:** Marvin holding a glowing phone, eyes swirling in madness.
-   **Style:** `Glitch Horror`, `Cyberpunk`, `Psychological Thriller`.

## ⚠️ 4. CHECKLIST

-   [ ] **No Tech Jargon.** (No "LLM", "Weights", "Inference"). Use "Chatbot", "Program", "Voice".
-   [ ] **Georgia-Specific:** "Is your child safe in Tbilisi?" (Implied relevance).
-   [ ] **Music:** Industrial Drone, heartbeat, unsettling high-pitch glitch.
