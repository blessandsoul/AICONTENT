--- [START OF OUTPUT] ---

- **BODY PARAGRAPHS (5 emoji headlines)**: MIN 85% of total content
- **FACEBOOK TARGET**: 3500-4500 characters total
- **TELEGRAM TARGET**: 750-1000 characters total

The MEAT of the content goes in the BODY PARAGRAPHS, not in the intro.

[Emoji] [Short punchy sentence based on topic]

[Main threat/news in plain text] — one sentence with direct "Pain Injection".

[1-2 SHORT sentences of context. NO MORE. This is NOT the place for deep analysis.]

> ⚠️ CONSTRAINT: Intro section (hook + pain + context) = MAX 15% of post. Keep it SHORT.

[UNIQUE Emoji] [UNIQUE 2-3 WORD HEADLINE] - [FULL PARAGRAPH: 5-8 sentences of deep analysis, technical details, cynical breakdown. THIS IS WHERE THE MEAT GOES.]
[UNIQUE Emoji] [UNIQUE 2-3 WORD HEADLINE] - [FULL PARAGRAPH: 5-8 sentences. Different angle, implications, future consequences.]
[UNIQUE Emoji] [UNIQUE 2-3 WORD HEADLINE] - [FULL PARAGRAPH: 5-8 sentences. Specific examples, data, quotes.]
[UNIQUE Emoji] [UNIQUE 2-3 WORD HEADLINE] - [FULL PARAGRAPH: 5-8 sentences. Technical breakdown or business analysis.]
[UNIQUE Emoji] [UNIQUE 2-3 WORD HEADLINE] - [FULL PARAGRAPH: 5-8 sentences. Final cynical conclusion, what it means for user.]

> ⚠️ CONSTRAINT: Each body paragraph MUST be 5-8 sentences. NOT 1-2 sentences. The body paragraphs are 85% of the content.

RULE: EVERY paragraph in this section MUST start with an Emoji and a Headline. No exceptions.
CRITICAL: Headlines are PLAIN TEXT. NO bold formatting. Example: `🧂 მარილის რევოლუცია - text...`

🫣 [Thematic hook/survival question]? იპოვეთ Andrew Altair Google-ში.
(მაგ: "გსურთ ისწავლოთ აგენტების მართვა? იპოვეთ Andrew Altair Google-ში")

[Georgian hashtags only. Brand names can be English.]

⚠️ CRITICAL RULE: HASHTAGS ARE THE LAST LINE OF FACEBOOK POST.
- NO 🔗 line after hashtags
- NO additional CTA after hashtags  
- The 🫣 CTA comes BEFORE hashtags
- Hashtags = END OF FACEBOOK POST

CORRECT ORDER:
1. 🫣 CTA line
2. Hashtags (END)

❌ WRONG - DO NOT DO THIS:
```
🫣 CTA line
#hashtags
🔗 Another CTA line  <-- THIS IS BANNED
```


--- [TELEGRAM CONTENT STARTS HERE] ---
