# 🎨 VISUAL STRATEGY MATRIX (AGGRESSIVE RANDOMIZER)

**INSTRUCTION:** When generating a prompt, select a Strategy ID (1-10). You MUST **append or replace** the corresponding sections in your prompt with these specific details to ensure maximum visual difference.

| ID | Strategy | Concept | **SUBJECT / ACTION MODIFIER** (Append to Subject) | **COMPOSITION / CAMERA MODIFIER** (Override Camera/Angle) | **STYLE / LIGHTING MODIFIER** (Append to Style) |
|----|----------|---------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Uncanny Eye** | Breaking 4th Wall | `staring directly into the camera lens, uncomfortably close, pupil reflecting the viewer's room` | `Extreme Close-up (Macro), breaking the 4th wall` | `Ring light reflection in eyes, uncomfortable hyper-realism` |
| 2 | **Scale Domination** | Giant Character | `looming gigantically over a tiny miniature city/server room, crushing a building with one finger` | `Tilt-Shift lens, Low angle looking up at giant subject` | `Depth of field making environment look like toys` |
| 3 | **Trigger Colors** | Anxiety/Sickness | `sickly, sweating, holding a radioactive barrel or leaking substance` | `Dutch Angle (tilted 45 degrees), disorienting` | `Sodium Vapor (Yellow) & Nuclear Green palette, monochromatic anxiety` |
| 4 | **Reflection** | Mirror Story | `wearing reflective sunglasses that show a nuclear explosion or screaming face in the reflection` | `Close-up on the reflective surface (glasses/helmet)` | `High contrast reflection, ray-tracing enabled` |
| 5 | **Bio-Horror** | Tech Fusion | `half-face melted off revealing terminator skull, wires growing out of fur, skin transparent` | `Clinical medical photography style, sharp focus` | `Translucent materials, sub-surface scattering, body horror` |
| 6 | **Glitch Reality** | Matrix Breaking | `glitching out of existence, body parts fragmented into pixels, face distorted by datamosh` | `Camera motion blur, shutter drag effect` | `Datamoshing, chromatic aberration, digital artifacts, broken jpeg` |
| 7 | **Sensory Overload** | Dense Atmosphere | `standing in a hurricane of flying money/papers/debris, screaming against the wind` | `Wide angle, deep depth of field to show chaos` | `Heavy volumetric fog, sparks, rain, particulate matter everywhere` |
| 8 | **GoPro Action** | POV Victim | `reaching out to grab the camera lens aggressively, attacking the viewer` | `Fisheye Lens (GoPro POV), barrel distortion` | `Shaky cam aesthetic, high motion blur on edges` |
| 9 | **Genre Bending** | Canvas/VHS | `posing dramatically like a Renaissance painting or cryptic VHS footage` | `Static tripod shot or Classic Portrait framing` | `Chiaroscuro (Caravaggio lighting) OR VHS tracking lines & grain` |
| 10 | **Object Contrast** | Real vs Toon | `holding a PHOTREALISTIC rotting human skull or a smashed iPhone 16 Pro Max` | `Focus pull on the realistic object` | `Contrast between Toon Shader and Photorealistic Texture` |
