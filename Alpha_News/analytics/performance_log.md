## 🧠 Key Learnings (Initial Data)

| Strategy | Performance | Insight |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **"Forbidden" Knowledge / Utility** | 🏆 **High Engagement (206)** | Users want *power* and *tools*. "Forbidden Prompts", "Billionaire Brain", "Magic Wand". High save/share value. |
| **Geopolitics / "Free Stuff"** | 🥈 Medium Engagement (84) | "China buying world for $0" worked decent (6k views). "Us vs Them" narrative and "Free" trigger words work. |
| **Big Tech Failure / News** | 📉 Low Engagement (54) | "Siri Dead" (2k views). Pure news/tech failure didn't click as well as personal empowerment or geopolitical conflict. |

**Winning Formula**: Give the user a "System" or "Secret Weapon" to become elite (Andrew Altair/Naval/Musk style). News should be framed as "How this affects YOU/Your Money" vs just "Company X failed".

## 📝 Full Transcripts & Analysis

### 🟢 #1 Top Performer: 7 Forbidden Prompts
**Stats**: 6k Views, 206 Engagement
**Hook**: "Imagine holding a magic wand (ChatGPT)... These prompts turn it into a nuclear reactor."

**Why it worked:**
*   **Asset vs Tool**: Frames ChatGPT as a "Magic Wand" / "Nuclear Reactor".
*   **Identity Shift**: Prompts for "Billionaire Brain", "Matrix Mode", "God-tier life".
*   **Specific Utility**: Copy-paste value. People save this to use later.
*   **Persona**: Andrew Altair serving as the "Gateway to Exclusive Knowledge".

### 🟡 #2: Microsoft Panic / China
**Stats**: 6k Views, 84 Engagement
**Hook**: "Your digital future is already sold, and the price is $0."

**Why it worked:**
*   **Fear/Loss**: "Already sold".
*   **Free**: "Price is $0" is a huge hook.
*   **David vs Goliath**: Poor south vs Rich north, Free vs Expensive.
*   **Strong Words**: "Panic", "War", "Occupation".

### 🔴 #3: Apple/Siri Dead
**Stats**: 2k Views, 54 Engagement
**Hook**: "Apple raised the white flag: Siri is officially 'brain dead'."

**Why it lagged:**
*   **Old News feel?**: Maybe users already know Siri is bad?
*   **Less High Stakes**: Siri being bad doesn't threaten the user personally like "Your future is sold" or offer gain like "Become a Billionaire".
*   **Abstract**: "Architecture crash", "Strategic dead end" - a bit too analytical vs emotional.
