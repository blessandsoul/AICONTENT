# 🧠 CONTEXT HANDOFF: The Ecosystem Pivot (Jan 18, 2026)

## 📍 CURRENT STATE
We have analyzed Facebook & TikTok data (Dec-Jan) and radically restructured the AI Agent Ecosystem to serve the business goal: **Monetize `andrewaltair.ge`**.

## 📊 KEY DATA INSIGHTS
1.  **Fear Sells:** "Grok Pentagon" (30k views) & "Cyber Crime" beat everything else.
2.  **Debunking Fails:** "Tylenol is Safe" (12 views) was a disaster. FB audience hates being calmed down.
3.  **Art is Dead (on FB):** Pure Prompts/Aesthetics (<150 views) do not work on Facebook.
4.  **Golden Window:** 21:00 - 23:00 is the peak traffic time.

## 🔄 NEW STRATEGY: "THE ECOSYSTEM"
Each agent now has a specific business role in the funnel:

### 1. 🐍 Eden AI (The Traffic Warhead)
*   **Role:** **Viral Traffic Generator.**
*   **Mission:** "Social Media Bombardment".
*   **Strategy:** **"Digital Prey"**. Use Fear, Scandal, & Tech-Crime hooks to drive clicks.
*   **Platform:** TikTok / Facebook Reels.
*   **Funnel:** "Read the full shocking report on `andrewaltair.ge`."

### 2. 🧪 Deep Science & 🗞️ Alpha News (The Authority)
*   **Role:** **SEO & Indexing Architects.**
*   **Mission:** Build Domain Authority for Google & AI Search.
*   **Strategy:**
    *   **Website:** Deep, academic, technical content (15k+ chars).
    *   **Socials:** ONLY "Teasers" or "Fear Hooks" pointing to the site. NO full articles on FB.

### 3. 🎨 Prompt Master (The Factory)
*   **Role:** **Marketplace Inventory.**
*   **Mission:** Create Products (Prompts, Bots) to SELL.
*   **Strategy:** The "Goods" that Eden markets. Invisible on FB as a standalone entity.
