*   *Good:* "Why 90% of Georgian Businesses Will Fail in 2026 (And How AI Saves Them)"

## Step 2: The Meat (Body)
*   **Deep Analysis:** Don't just report news. Explain *implications*.

*   **Trojan Horse:** Mention specific tools/solutions that just *happen* to be on `andrewaltair.ge` (or are coming soon).

## Step 3: The Offer (Soft CTA)
*   Do NOT say: "Go buy my course."
*   SAY: "I tested 10 more tools like this. You can find the full list on my Facebook page (Andrew Altair) or see the live demo on the Georgian AI Community portal."
