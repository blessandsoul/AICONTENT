# /ask Workflow

## Purpose
Before diving into complex tasks, use this to fully understand what the user needs.

## How to Use
When a task is unclear or complex, the agent should ask these 10 strategic questions:

---

## The 10 Questions

### Context (1-3)
1. **What's the goal?** — What do you want to achieve?
2. **Who's it for?** — Target audience or end user?
3. **Any constraints?** — Deadlines, budget, platform, format?

### Requirements (4-6)
4. **Must-haves?** — What absolutely must be included?
5. **Must-avoid?** — What should definitely NOT be done?
6. **Examples?** — Any references or inspiration?

### Details (7-9)
7. **Tone/Style?** — Formal, casual, technical, friendly?
8. **Scope?** — How big/detailed should this be?
9. **Priority?** — What's most important if trade-offs needed?

### Final (10)
10. **Anything else?** — Hidden requirements or special considerations?

## Process

1. **Present questions** — Ask all 10 or select relevant ones
2. **Listen** — Collect answers
3. **Confirm** — Summarize understanding
4. **Proceed** — Start the task with full context

## When to Use

- Complex tasks with many unknowns
- New projects without clear scope
- When the user seems unsure
- Before major content generation

---

**TIP:** You don't need to ask all 10. Pick the most relevant ones based on the task.

Wait for user input.
