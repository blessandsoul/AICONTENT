# Entities

This folder stores dossiers for tracked people, companies, and organizations.

## Usage

1. When an agent encounters an important entity, create a dossier using `DOSSIER_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Save as `[entity_name].md` (e.g., `elon_musk.md`, `openai.md`)
3. Update dossiers when new information is discovered
4. All agents can read/write to this folder

## Example Structure

```
entities/
├── elon_musk.md
├── openai.md
├── google.md
└── ...
```

*Add dossiers as you encounter important entities.*
