# 🗺️ Roadmap — How to Grow Your System

A progression path from beginner to advanced agent ecosystem.

---

## Level 1: Single Agent (Start Here)

**Goal:** Get one agent working well.

### Steps:
1. ✅ Copy `Sample_Agent/` or an Archetype
2. ✅ Customize SKILL.md with your persona
3. ✅ Create a workflow (`/yourcommand`)
4. ✅ Test and refine

### You Have:
- 1 working agent
- 1 workflow command
- Basic output

---

## Level 2: Add Second Brain

**Goal:** Create a central controller.

### Steps:
1. Set up `Second_Brain/` with your profile
2. Fill in `context/` files (profile, goals, projects)
3. Register your agent in Second Brain's roster
4. Test invoking agent through Second Brain

### You Have:
- Central controller (Second Brain)
- 1+ specialized agent
- Personalized context

---

## Level 3: Multi-Agent System

**Goal:** Multiple specialized agents working together.

### Steps:
1. Add more agents (Coder, Designer, Writer, etc.)
2. Create workflows for each
3. Register all in Second Brain
4. Define agent collaboration rules

### You Have:
- 3-5 specialized agents
- Central coordination
- Clear division of labor

---

## Level 4: Memory & Learning

**Goal:** Agents that remember and improve.

### Steps:
1. Implement memory files in each agent
2. Log successful outputs
3. Track failures and lessons
4. Add pre-flight history checks

### You Have:
- Persistent memory
- Learning from mistakes
- Improving over time

---

## Level 5: Quality System

**Goal:** Consistent, high-quality outputs.

### Steps:
1. Create Golden Samples for each agent
2. Add validation protocols
3. Implement self-correction loops
4. Track performance metrics

### You Have:
- Quality assurance
- Consistent outputs
- Measurable improvement

---

## Level 6: Automation

**Goal:** Reduce manual work.

### Steps:
1. Create validation scripts
2. Automate memory syncing
3. Build template generators
4. Set up performance dashboards

### You Have:
- Automated quality checks
- Less manual oversight
- Scalable system

---

## Level 7: Advanced Patterns

**Goal:** Sophisticated multi-agent workflows.

### Steps:
1. Chain agents (A → B → C)
2. Implement agent-to-agent communication
3. Create specialized BIBLE rules
4. Build custom archetypes

### You Have:
- Complex workflows
- Full ecosystem
- Unique system

## Where to Focus

| If you want... | Focus on... |
|----------------|-------------|
| Quick results | Level 1-2 |
| Multiple use cases | Level 3 |
| Better quality | Level 4-5 |
| Scale | Level 6 |
| Power user | Level 7 |

---

## Tips for Each Level

**Level 1-2:** Don't over-engineer. Get something working first.

**Level 3:** Keep agents focused. One agent = one purpose.

**Level 4-5:** Review logs regularly. Patterns emerge over time.

**Level 6-7:** Document everything. Future you will thank you.
