(REFERENCE IMAGE PRIORITY: Maintain character features). A hyper-realistic cinematic shot of The Subject sitting alone in a pitch-black, abandoned animation studio. The Subject is NOT a toy, but living, breathing entity that looks aged, depressed, and forgotten. Worn-out texture, matted fur/skin, sad eyes looking at the floor. The studio is covered in dust and cobwebs.

Background & Text: A dusty "ANDREWALTAIR.GE" sign is barely visible on the floor, illuminated by the flashlight beam. The text is white, distressed, but legible.

Technical: 8k resolution, Unreal Engine 5 render, depressing atmosphere, found footage style, flashlight lighting, harsh shadows.
--negative_prompt: text distortion, watermark glitches, bad anatomy, blurry, low quality, gender specific features (unless from reference), cheerful, bright colors. --ar 9:16 --stylize 350 --style raw --v 6.0
