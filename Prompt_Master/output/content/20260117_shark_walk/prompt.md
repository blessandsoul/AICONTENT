(REFERENCE IMAGE PRIORITY: Maintain 100% facial likeness, hair color, and distinct features of the uploaded subject).

Surreal fine-art cinematic image of The Subject, a slender young figure walking on a quiet beach, same centered walking pose as the reference, arms down holding two leashes. On the left and right, two giant great white sharks appear to be calmly walking beside The Subject, hovering just above the sand. The Subject wears a light cream modern outfit, minimalistic fashion look, hair slightly messy from sea wind, head tilted down. Natural skin texture with visible pores, hyper-detailed.

Environment & Text Integration:
Background is pale foggy sky with faint ocean line, emotional minimalism. The Georgian text "SHARK WALKER — სიურეალიზმის მეფე" is subtly visible as weathered text carved into driftwood on the beach. The text "ANDREWALTAIR.GE" appears as a printed white label on the inside collar of The Subject's cream outfit, clearly legible.

Lighting & Camera:
Soft diffused lighting, muted color palette, overcast sky glow, ultra-detailed sharks with realistic skin texture, smooth surreal blending. Shot on Hasselblad X2D, fine-art photography quality, 8k resolution.
