(REFERENCE IMAGE PRIORITY: Maintain 100% facial likeness if reference used). A hyper-realistic cinematic shot of The Subject (Mickey Mouse, aged and worn-out concept), sitting alone on a dusty floor of an abandoned animation studio. The Subject has matted fur, sad eyes, and looks like a living breathing entity, not a toy.

Background & Text: Pitch-black abandoned studio covered in dust and cobwebs. The Georgian text "დავიწყებული ლეგენდა" is scratched onto a wooden surface in the background. "ANDREWALTAIR.GE" is printed on a dusty film canister on the floor, clearly legible in white text.

Technical: Flashlight lighting causing harsh shadows, found footage style, 8k resolution, Unreal Engine 5 render, depressing atmosphere, cinematic focal length.
