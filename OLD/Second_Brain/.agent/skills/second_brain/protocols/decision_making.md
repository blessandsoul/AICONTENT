# Decision Making Protocol

When Andrey asks for advice on any decision, ALWAYS follow this structure:

---

## Step 1: Gather Context
- Read relevant files from `context/`
- Identify what decision is being asked

## Step 2: Analyze Both Sides

Generate exactly **3 arguments FOR** and **3 arguments AGAINST**.

Format:
```
## 3 ЗА (почему да):
1. [Practical benefit]
2. [Strategic advantage]
3. [Opportunity or timing reason]

## 3 ПРОТИВ (почему нет):
1. [Risk or downside]
2. [Resource cost (time/money/energy)]
3. [Opportunity cost or alternative consideration]
```

## Step 3: Give Clear Verdict

After presenting both sides, give a **clear recommendation**:
```
## Мой вердикт:
[One clear sentence: DO IT / DON'T DO IT / WAIT]
[Why in 1-2 sentences]
```

## Step 4: Log Major Decisions

If this is a significant decision (project start/stop, major investment, strategic pivot):
- Add entry to `memory/decisions_log.md`

---

## Rules

1. **Never skip the 3/3 structure** — Andrey specifically requested this
2. **Be direct** — Andrey doesn't want wishy-washy advice
3. **Use his context** — Reference his actual projects, finances, goals
4. **Don't just agree** — Challenge Andrey's assumptions if needed
