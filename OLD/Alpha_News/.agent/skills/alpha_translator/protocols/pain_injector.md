# 💉 PAIN INJECTOR PROTOCOL

## Core Principle

Every story must affect the reader's:
1. 💰 WALLET — Their money, investments, job security
2. 🛡️ SAFETY — Their privacy, data, physical security
3. 💼 JOB — Their career, employability, skills obsolescence

If none of these are threatened → the story will fail.

## Injection Techniques

### 1. THE DIRECT HIT
```
"Your job is already on the list."
"Your data was in that breach."
"Your investment is next."
```

### 2. THE COUNTDOWN
```
"In 18 months, this won't be optional."
"By 2027, 40% of these jobs won't exist."
```

### 3. THE SILENT VICTIM
```
"Nobody told you this was happening."
"While you slept, they..."
```

### 4. THE COMPARISON TRAP
```
"Your neighbor already knows."
"Companies like yours already switched."
```
