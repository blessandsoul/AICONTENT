# 🎨 10 STRATEGIES FOR MIND-BLOWING VISUALS (PSYCHOLOGY & TECH)

To take the "Looney Tunes x Cyberpunk" style from *High Quality* to *Psychological Warfare*, apply these 10 layers:

## 🧠 PSYCHOLOGICAL ANCHORS

1.  **The "Uncanny Valley" Eye Contact**
    *   *Concept:* Use the **"Kubrick Stare"**. The character should not just look at the camera; they should look *through* the viewer.
    *   *Prompt Add:* `Eye contact breaking the fourth wall, piercing gaze, pupil reflection showing the viewer's room.`

2.  **Scale Domination (The "God" Perspective)**
    *   *Concept:* Make the character unnaturally large compared to the environment to induce a feeling of helplessness in the viewer.
    *   *Prompt Add:* `Macro photography of character's hand crushing a tiny city, Tilt-shift effect, giant looming scale.`

3.  **Visual "Trigger" Colors (Beyond Neon)**
    *   *Concept:* Neon Blue/Red is standard. Use **"Anxiety Yellow"** (Sodium Vapor) or **"Toxic Green"** (Nuclear). These colors instinctively signal sickness or danger.
    *   *Prompt Add:* `Sodium vapor lighting, sickly green radioactive glow, color palette of bruised purple and yellow.`

4.  **The "Reflection" Narrative**
    *   *Concept:* Tell a second story in the reflections. The character smiles, but the reflection in their sunglasses shows a screaming face.
    *   *Prompt Add:* `Reflections on glasses show a burning world, visual storytelling in metallic surfaces.`

## 👁️ VISUAL FIDELITY & TEXTURE

5.  **Biomechanical Fusion (Body Horror Lite)**
    *   *Concept:* Instead of just holding tech, the tech should be *part* of them. Wile E. Coyote's arm *is* a schematic blueprint.
    *   *Prompt Add:* `Translucent skin revealing glowing circuitry underneath, fur turning into fiber optic cables, biomechanical horror details.`

6.  **"Glitch" Reality**
    *   *Concept:* The render itself should look like it's fighting the simulation. Datamoshing in a still image.
    *   *Prompt Add:* `Datamoshing effect, digital artifacting on edges, reality dissolving into pixels, chromatic aberration on motion blur.`

7.  **Atmospheric Density (Sensory Overload)**
    *   *Concept:* The air shouldn't be empty. It should be heavy. Dust, rain, sparks, floating data.
    *   *Prompt Add:* `Heavy particulate matter in air, floating dust motes illuminated by laser light, oppressive humidity, sparks form rain.`

## 🎬 CINEMATIC & VARIATION

8.  **The "GoPro" Action Shot**
    *   *Concept:* Placing the camera directly *on* the action. First-person view (POV) of being attacked or targeted.
    *   *Prompt Add:* `Action Camera POV attached to character's chest, extreme fish-eye lens (12mm), heavy motion blur on edges, chaotic energy.`

9.  **Genre Bending (Style Mixing)**
    *   *Concept:* Mix "Looney Tunes" not just with Cyberpunk, but with **Renaissance Oil Painting** or **Analog Horror (VHS)**.
    *   *Prompt Add:* `Chiaroscuro lighting (Caravaggio style), VHS tape grain overlay, tracking lines, photorealistic fur scanlines.`

10. **Object Juxtaposition (The Prop)**
    *   *Concept:* Marvin the Martian holding something "Real World" and mundane creates a terrifying contrast. E.g., Holding a realistic, dirty human skull or a recognizable iPhone.
    *   *Prompt Add:* `Hyper-realistic props contrasting with stylized character, Marvin holding a cracked iPhone 16 showing a 'System Failure' screen.`

## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
When you want to increase variability, we can add a `{VISUAL_MODIFIER}` slot to the prompt generator that randomly picks one of these 10 strategies for each post.
