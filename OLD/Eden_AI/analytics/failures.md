## Common Failure Patterns

### Hook Failures
- Starting with obscure name (nobody knows them)
- Hook too long (3+ sentences before punch)
- No number/statistic in opening

### Engagement Failures
- No clear villain (passive voice)
- Story too complicated (3+ main characters)
- No call-to-action (no comments, no part 2)

### Visual Failures
- Too busy background (distracts from speaker)
- Bright colors (jarring on dark feed)
- Concrete objects instead of abstract

### Loop Failures
- Abrupt ending (no connector)
- Connector doesn't match opening
- Story feels complete (no mystery left)
