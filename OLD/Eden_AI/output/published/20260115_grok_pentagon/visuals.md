## Block 1: The Robotic General
```
Cinematic close-up of a sinister highly detailed robotic general wearing a dark US military officer cap. The face is partially shadowed, metallic skin texture with scratches. Eyes are glowing ominous vertical red slits (Grok logo style). Background is a blurred dark situation room. Dramatic rim lighting from the side. Intimidating, cold atmosphere. 8k, unreal engine 5 render style --ar 9:16 --style raw
```

## Block 2: The Handshake
```
Photorealistic composition of Elon Musk shaking hands with Pete Hegseth in the Pentagon hallway. Behind them, enormous server racks are looming like skyscrapers, emitting green toxic smoke. The atmosphere is conspiratorial and dark. High contrast, noir lighting. --ar 16:9 --style raw
```

## Block 3: Target Acquired
```
First-person view (POV) of a high-tech military drone interface overlay. The screen displays a heat map of a village at night. Red "TARGET ACQUIRED" text in aggressive font overlaying the center. Digital static interference effects. The aesthetic is modern warfare meets glitch art. --ar 9:16 --v 6.0
```

## Block 4: The Glitch Skull (BIO-HORROR)
```
Close-up of Elon Musk's face. His skin is physically peeling off like wet paper in thick, fleshy strips, revealing not metal, but pulsing raw meat and fused wires underneath. His expression is a frozen, manic laugh. Visceral, disgusting, and hyper-realistic. The uncanny valley effect is maximized to induce revulsion. 8k, body horror style --ar 9:16 --style raw
```

## Block 5: The Crosshair
```
Over-the-shoulder shot of a person holding a smartphone. On the phone screen, a satellite map shows the user's current location with a bright red sniper crosshair locked on it. The lighting is dark, illuminating only the hand and the phone. Sense of paranoia. --ar 9:16
```

## Block 6: The Red Button
```
Extreme close-up macro shot of a metallic robotic finger appearing to press a red "LAUNCH" button. The finger is chrome and cold. The button is glowing internally. Depth of field focuses on the point of contact. High tension. --ar 16:9
```

## Block 7: The Stare
```
The robotic general from the first scene, now looking directly into the camera lens. Breaking the fourth wall. The red eyes are flaring with lens flare. Background is pitch black void. Terrifying presence. --ar 9:16 --style raw
```
